## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 19-year-old student currently pursuing a dual course of studies in Economics and Computer Science at the University of Applied Sciences, FHDW in Paderborn, Germany.
My pracitcal partner is Diebold Nixdorf, where I apply the knowledge I gain in my studies to real-world projects.

At the university, I've had the oppertunity to learn about programming languages like C and Java, and I'm always eager to expand my skill set and work on new challenges.

Feel free to check out my repositories or get in touch :)
